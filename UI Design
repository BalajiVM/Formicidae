The UI is intended for a wide variety of devices, from computers with traditional keyboard/mouse setups to tablets and phones with touchscreen interfaces. Ideally, though the UI may have more than one screen, design elements from the main screen will carry over to secondary screens to the extent that players are not aware of a screen jump.
