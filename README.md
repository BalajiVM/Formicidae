#Formicidae
An HTML5 SimAnt clone(ish) with improved graphics and interface.

### Technologies Used

- HTML5
- Tiled tilemap maker/editor

### Attribution
Thanks to @jkstawn for providing the graphical base for the ants and many great ideas listed in his README

(I didn't fork the repo because the technology behind the game is entirely different, only the README and
the graphics were sourced from the colonies repo.)
