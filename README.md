#Formicidae
An HTML5 SimAnt clone(ish) with improved graphics and interface.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5, JS
- Tiled tilemap maker/editor

## Goals

1. It should be faithful to the original's idea of a "scientific" ant colony simulation. Obviously the science has changed a little since the days of SimAnt, but the raison d'etre needs no alteration. This should be an "edutainment" title in the best sense of the term, like Oregon Trail or Civilization games have been. 

2. It should be multi-player capable.

3. Ideally there would be several different kinds of ant colonies modeled - there are significant differences between the ways Leafcutters, Argentine, and Siafu ants run their colonies, and it would be very cool for the player to be able to select their colony type and the colony types of their opponents (when playing against the computer).

4. Again, Ideally, different species (appearance, behavior, etc.) would be based on a modable system, allowing for the user community to enhance gameplay.

5. Animation should be engaging, but not overly distracting. 2D gameplay.
